# Habit Tracker for OOFPP Course at IU
To run the habit tracker clone the repo, then run the main.py file. It's currently super super wip, but it can import the dummy database, list the habits in it, perform them and add an additional predefined new habit.

But the base backbone for a lot of parts is set up in the other files like the base classes, database connection and a test suite.
