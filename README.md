# Habit Tracker - A Project for OOFPP at IU
Most people looking into productivity tools have at this point most likely heard of a habit tracker.
It's a tool to track regular habits like exercising or watering one's plants
to give you an easy to-do-list for your day of the things that actually matter to you.
I created this particular version of a habit tracker as my assignment for the course
Object Oriented and Functional Programming with Python at IU and learned a lot during development
(as can be plainly seen when looking back on the early versions of the tracker).

To add a bit of flavor to the project, I chose to give the entire application a bit of a gardening theme, letting you
plant and grow your habits as one would add to and nurture in a garden.

## Functionality
The habit tracker in its base form allows you to create habits, check them off as finished, or delete them.
Additionally, you can check various statistics regarding your habits.

### Create a Habit

The application was developed in Python 3.11,
so older versions might not support all functionalities used in the application.
Additionally, in order to run the application,
you will first need to ensure all required packages and modules are installed.
For this you can run the following command in your python terminal.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Test Suite
For testing all functionalities of the application as test suite has been provided,
which you can call in the python terminal with the following command.
